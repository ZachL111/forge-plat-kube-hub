# forge-plat-kube-hub

`forge-plat-kube-hub` packages a practical platform engineering exercise in Java. The emphasis is on deterministic behavior, a small public API, and examples that explain the tradeoffs.

## How I Read Forge Plat Kube Hub

The useful thing to inspect here is how the same score rule is represented in code, metadata, and examples. If those three pieces disagree, the audit script should make the drift visible.

## Problem Shape

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Internal Model

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The Java implementation uses a compact package layout and direct assertion checks.

## Scenario Walkthrough

`pressure` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `review` path with a score of 139. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at 60 and `surge` at 285, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## Main Behaviors

- Uses fixture data to keep route policy changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for rollout constraints, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents environment checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Run It Locally

Use a normal shell with Java available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Repository Map

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Known Edges

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Follow-Up Work

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more platform engineering fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## How To Run It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.
